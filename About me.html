									<h2 class="project-title">About Me</h2>
									</p>I’ve always been the kind of person who loves figuring out how things work. Whether it was building something from scratch or just taking things apart, my curiosity led me to engineering. It’s what drives me to keep learning and exploring new challenges every day. Outside of work, I’m all about growing as a person and making a positive impact on the people around me. I’m happiest when I’m out in nature—whether I’m hiking, fishing, or just enjoying the outdoors. One of my biggest dreams is to travel the world and experience all the amazing things this planet has to offer.</p>								</div>

									<h3 class="major">Passions and Hobbies: </h3>
<p> <strong>Outdoor Adventures:</strong> Spending time outdoors is one of my biggest passions. Whether it's fishing during the summer, hiking through nature, or skateboarding in my free time, I always find joy in being active outside. I love exploring new places and seeing everything the world has to offer. There's so much beauty out there, and I try to take any opportunity I can to travel and experience it firsthand. For me, being outdoors is a way to recharge, challenge myself, and embrace new experiences. It’s one of the many ways I try to live life to the fullest.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Passion for Drones: </h3>
<p> <strong>Flying Drones and Cinematic Adventures:</strong> Building and flying drones has become one of my favorite hobbies. There's something incredibly satisfying about designing and tuning an FPV drone to fly at its best, whether for racing or just pushing the limits of my engineering skills. Learning to fly FPV drones was a steep learning curve, but that challenge made it all the more rewarding. Now, flying FPV drones is a way for me to have fun while constantly improving and learning. On top of that, capturing stunning footage from the sky has opened up a whole new world for me—being able to see places from a perspective you can't get otherwise. It's pushed me into the realm of videography, where I'm learning the intricacies of camera work, capturing cinematic shots, and diving into video editing and color grading to make the footage look as polished and impactful as possible.

								<h3 class="major">Tunring a Passion into a Side Buisness:</h3>
								<p><strong></strong> I'm now working on turning my passion for drones into a potential side business. Real estate filming is the path I'm most excited about, and I'm particularly interested in taking it a step further than standard exterior shots. While many can offer simple drone photos, I want to bring something different to the table: real estate FPV fly-throughs. It's a super niche skill that few can offer, but it's incredibly challenging and rewarding. FPV fly-throughs provide a unique, immersive perspective that could transform how homes are showcased, and I'm working hard to turn this idea into a reality.
